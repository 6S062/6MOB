Course title: Mobile and Sensor Computing
(not IoT)

Hari wants course to be "Sensor-centric"
    "How to acquire, deliver, process, make sense of sensor data"
Also,
    Connectivity
    Actuation

Lectures:
    2 per week, 1-1.5 hr (Hari wants to let the students go early)
    15-16 lectures

Mobile Phones, Sensors, and the Cloud
    Think about Waze, Fitbit
    Phone as gateway between sensor network and Internet

Should we draw a distinction between sensors that are attached to things that move, things that don't move?

Lecture topics:
    Positioning technologies
        Outdoor (GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular positioning; localization framework on iOS)
        Indoor localization
        Inertial measurement
        Mapping, navigation APIs, systems
    Networking
        3G -- architecture, fundamental difference with Wi-Fi, statefulness and power, latency, reliability
    Data
        Compare & contrast SQLite vs BerkeleyDB
        How do I organize and store the data I capture?
        Lab: Test the performance of SQLite on different iOS versions
            Local filesystem benchmarks
        Eventually, you want to get this into the cloud
            Consistency and synchronization of data
            How does your calendar work?
            Eventual consistency
        Anonymization/aggregation
        Geospatial indexes
    NFC
        Apple Pay
        RFID?
    Techniques for downsampling streams
        Video, audio, acceleration
    Time synchronization
        Clock drift motivates the introduction of dynamic time warping
    Mobile security
        How sandboxes work
        Fingerprint sensors
        Malware and untrusted applications

    Case studies / possible invited talks
        Fitbit
        Analog Devices
        Medical implants

Group project ideas:
    Medical implants
    IMU data filtering
