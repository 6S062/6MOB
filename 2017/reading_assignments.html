            <p>Respond the following question briefly (2-3 sentences or a bulleted
            list):<br> The PlaceLab paper was written more than 10 years ago.  What
            aspects of its design are still relevant today, and which aspects have
            been made obsolete by changes in technology?</p>

            <!--<p>In your own words (don’t copy from the paper), in one or two
            sentences, explain what the “gateway problem” is, as illustrated by

            other choice is to use an intermediate node, N; the probability of
            successfully receiving an ACK for a packet from S to N is p, the
            same as the probability of successfully receiving an ACK for a
            packet sent from N to T.</p>

            <p>Using ETX, under what conditions would the direct link from S to
            T be preferred to the path S &mdash; N &mdash; T?</p>-->

<p><strong>TBD</strong></p>
<!--<p>A simple method to detect potholes would be to look at time windows during which the absolute magnitude of the acceleration vector is above some threshold.
This will lead to a number of false positives, as described in the paper.  After reading the paper, list two sources of such false positives, and how the paper
proposes to address them.</p>-->

<p><strong>TBD</strong></p>
<!--<p>In the paper by Biagioni and Eriksson, to find road centerlines, the authors
develop a new <b>gray-scale skeletonization</b> method.  This method iterates
through binary skeletonization starting from the highest density level and
proceeding downwards in density levels. <b>Why does it produce a better result
than using binary skeletonization once at a low density level?</b></p>-->
