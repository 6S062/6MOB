            We will have a poster session Wednesday, May 10 from 11-12:30 in
            the lounge on the 9th floor of the Gates tower of the Stata center.
            </p>

            <p>
            There will be pizza.
            </p>

            <p>
            Please prepare a poster up to 36x42 inches, or 12-16 printed slides
            in 8.5x11 inch format that you can tape up.  We will provide poster
            boards, easels, and mounting materials. If you are a member of
            CSAIL there is a large format poster printer on the 2nd floor; it
            is not necessary to use this, however.
            </p>

            <p>
            You should prepare a 7 minute presentation about your project,
            leaving us 3 minutes for discussion and questions.  Be prepared to
            show experimental results, demos, videos, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
            When you are not presenting to the staff, you can eat pizza and
            talk to other groups about their projects.  We will invite other
            students and faculty who will come to learn about your work as
            well.
            </p>

            <h5 id="abstract">Titles and Abstracts</h5>
            <p>
            We will be sending out a list of your projects in order to attract
            interested parties from the MIT community.  Consequently, before
            7pm on May 10, you need to post on Piazza a short, one-paragraph
            abstract (summary) outlining the problem you tackled and the
            results you will present, and an appropriate title for your
            abstract/demo.  For instance:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Title: Ultra-local Allergen Crowdsourcing<br>
                Every year, millions of sufferers react to pollens, molds, and
                pollutants that vary dramatically from place-to-place and
                hour-to-hour due to individual plants, mold colonies, and
                weather conditions.  Unfortunately, allergy testing is
                expensive, unpleasant, and error-prone, and public allergen
                data is inaccurate and coarse-grained.  We developed a cheap,
                embedded sensor platform that collects photomicrographs from
                air samples onto a cloud server, where we train a computer
                vision algorithm to recognize pollen grains and mold spores.
                In addition, we developed an app that allows people to report
                allergic symptoms, tagged with location and time information.
                By combining these sources of data and leveraging the power of
                wishful thinking in the cloud, we have created a novel tool for
                the identification of specific allergies for potential
                immunotherapeutic treatment.
