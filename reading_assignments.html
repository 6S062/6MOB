            <p>Respond the following question briefly (2-3 sentences or a bulleted
            list):<br> The PlaceLab paper was written more than 10 years ago.  What
            aspects of its design are still relevant today, and which aspects have
            been made obsolete by changes in technology?</p>

            <p>RADAR and Cricket are two indoor location systems. List two
            things in common between these two systems, and two things that are
            different.</p>

            <li id="2016-02-22"><strong>2016-02-22: Gateway Problem</strong>
            <p>In your own words (don’t copy from the paper), in one or two
            sentences, explain what the “gateway problem” is, as illustrated by
            the paper “The Internet of Things Has a Gateway Problem”.

            <li id="2016-02-24"><strong>2016-02-24: ETX</strong>
            <p>Suppose we want to send data from node S to node T in a
            multi-hop wireless network. The probability of successfully
            receiving an ACK for a packet sent from S to T directly is q. The
            other choice is to use an intermediate node, N; the probability of
            successfully receiving an ACK for a packet from S to N is p, the
            same as the probability of successfully receiving an ACK for a
            packet sent from N to T.</p>

            <p>Using ETX, under what conditions would the direct link from S to
            T be preferred to the path S &mdash; N &mdash; T?</p>
