In addition to exposure to fundamental technologies (power management, positioning, ranging, wireless radios, inertial sensors, etc), students will learn how to design and implement (1) libraries and applications on mobile devices that interact with internal and external sensors, (2) server-side modules for computation and storage, and (3) embedded software.   \r\n\r\n## Readings and Assignments\r\n\r\nDay | Topic | Reading | Assignment\r\n----|-------|---------|-----------\r\n2/3/2016 | Introduction to sensor computing | None | [[Lab 1][lab1]]\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
